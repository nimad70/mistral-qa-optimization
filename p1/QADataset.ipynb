This dual propagation route could lead to more complex patterns of disease progression, reflecting both classical and alternative pathways simultaneously.\\n\\nComplementing the classical model, the amygdala-anterior hippocampal pathway emphasizes the amygdala's role in early Alzheimer’s disease. This pathway highlights the importance of the limbic system in NFT spread, with the amygdala being crucial for emotional processing and memory consolidation. By acknowledging the amygdala as another source of NFTs, it enhances our understanding of disease complexity and diversity.\\n\\nThe existence of multiple NFT propagation routes suggests different subtypes of Alzheimer’s disease, with distinct clinical, pathological, and genetic features. For instance, some individuals may show predominant entorhinal-hippocampal involvement, while others may exhibit significant amygdalar changes early in the disease.

The central nucleus (CeA) is involved in fear responses and motor actions, receiving projections from the thalamus and cerebellum. The medial nucleus (MeA) is implicated in behaviors related to aggression, sexual behavior, and defensive responses, connecting with the hypothalamus and brainstem.\\n\\nAnxiety and fear in Alzheimer’s patients can be linked to the BLA-CeA circuitry, which is involved in fear conditioning. Alterations in this pathway in AD may increase anxiety and fearfulness. Depression is associated with the amygdala-hippocampal network, particularly the BLA-hippocampus connection, which is essential for mood regulation. Disruptions in this circuitry can lead to depressive symptoms. Agitation and irritability may result from disrupted connections between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, affecting emotional regulation and executive function. Apathy is linked to dysfunction in the amygdala-striatal pathway, which regulates motivation and reward.\\n\\nUnderstanding these connectivity patterns and functional roles allows for developing targeted interventions. For instance, therapies aimed at stabilizing BLA-CeA circuitry could reduce anxiety and fear. Treatments enhancing amygdala-hippocampal connectivity might alleviate depressive symptoms, while strategies to improve amygdala-prefrontal cortex communication could mitigate agitation and irritability.

CTCF and cohesin are key players in mediating these interactions. CTCF functions as an insulator and binding site, forming looped chromatin structures that define TAD boundaries, preventing the spread of transcriptional activity across domains, and promoting tissue-specific gene expression. Cohesin stabilizes these loops and maintains 3D chromatin architecture. Depletion of CTCF disrupts TAD boundaries, leading to increased interactions between neighboring TADs and widespread changes in gene expression, affecting both developmentally regulated and housekeeping genes. Some effects are reversible upon CTCF reintroduction, highlighting its role in maintaining chromatin organization and proper gene expression.\",\n","        \"Hi-C provides a global view of chromosomal interactions at high resolution, identifies both strong and weak long-range interactions, and constructs 3D models of chromosomes. However, it has limited resolution due to fragmentation and library preparation steps, potential for false positives or missing interactions, and is biased towards detecting strong interactions. SPRITE captures multiway chromatin interactions and offers insights into higher-order organization but is technically challenging and complex. Super-resolution microscopy provides detailed visualization at nanometer scale, revealing spatial relationships and chromatin organization but requires sophisticated equipment and expertise.\",\n","        \"Recent advancements in single-cell ATAC-seq allow profiling of chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution, identifying active CREs in diverse cell populations and understanding chromatin landscape changes during development, differentiation, and disease. High-throughput sequencing-based reporter assays, such as STARR-seq and MPRAs, enable functional validation of these CREs, measuring their transcriptional activity and providing insights into their regulatory potential and specific roles in gene transcription. These technologies together offer a comprehensive view of regulatory networks in cell type-specific gene expression.\",\n","        \"CRISPR-based epigenome-editing technologies, such as CRISPRi and CRISPRa, enable precise manipulation of enhancer activity, allowing validation of enhancer function in situ.
